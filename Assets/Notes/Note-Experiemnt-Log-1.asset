  noteContents: "Experiments with the \u2018Ghost Machine\u2019 are continuing, though
    trying to set it to the correct calibration for soul extraction is proving a
    challenge.\r\n\nIt seems getting it even slightly wrong destroys the \u2018soul\u2019
    inside, as subsequent attempts to use the machine on a body yield no response
    at all.\r\n\nI\u2019m getting through a lot of cadavers this way. \r\n\n- E.
